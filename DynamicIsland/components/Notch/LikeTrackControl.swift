/// This is the single place that maps `MusicManager.isCurrentTrackLiked`
/// (a `Bool?`, where `nil` means "unknown / not yet resolved") onto the

/// three player views can never drift apart.

/// Shared wrapper for the "like current track" heart button.
///
/// It owns the liked-state logic and the toggle action, and hands the derived
/// ``LikeTrackPresentation`` plus a `toggle` closure to a caller-supplied
/// `@ViewBuilder`. Each player view keeps rendering its *own* button chrome
/// (`HoverButton`, a private `controlButton`, …) so on-screen appearance and
/// animations are preserved — only the duplicated mapping and the
/// `.disabled` / `.opacity` modifiers are centralized here and applied once.
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// LikeTrackControl { presentation, toggle in
///     HoverButton(
///         icon: presentation.iconName,
///         iconColor: presentation.isActive ? brandAccentColor : .white,
///         scale: .medium
///     ) {
///         toggle()
///     }
/// }
/// ```
