/// saw "No lyrics found" for most of what they played (#713). NetEase's own
/// lyric store covers its own catalogue, but the player publishes only title,
/// artist, album and duration through Now Playing -- never a song id -- so
/// the track has to be found again by search before its lyrics can be asked
/// for. The duration is what makes that search trustworthy: a title-and-artist
/// hit whose length is off by more than a couple of seconds is a different
/// recording, and its timestamps would land every line at the wrong moment.
